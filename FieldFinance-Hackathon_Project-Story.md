# FieldFinance - Hackathon Project Submission

## Inspiration

We observed that many Hong Kong citizens are not actively engaged in personal financial management. Additionally, financial statements and data from banks are often overly complex and difficult for ordinary people to understand and interpret. This creates a barrier that prevents many individuals from taking control of their financial health and making informed decisions about their money.

Recognizing this gap, we were inspired to create a solution that would make financial management more accessible and engaging for the general public. Our vision was to develop a gamified and simplified application that would inspire Hong Kong citizens to consistently track and manage their finances while making the process enjoyable and easy to understand.

## What it does

FieldFinance is a comprehensive personal finance management application that combines practical functionality with engaging gamification elements. The core features include:

**Financial Tracking:** The app allows users to monitor their income, expenses, and financial goals in real-time, providing a clear overview of their financial status.

**Analytics Dashboard:** Users receive simple yet insightful analytics about their financial situation, presented in an easy-to-understand format that breaks down complex financial data into digestible insights.

**Gamification System:** The unique feature of our app is its game-like interface where users' financial activities translate into virtual crop growing mechanics. Income and expenses become elements that affect the growth and health of virtual crops, creating an engaging and motivating experience that encourages consistent financial management.

This dual approach ensures that users not only track their finances but also find the process enjoyable and rewarding, leading to better long-term financial habits.

## How we built it

Our development process was centered around leveraging AI-powered development tools, specifically Kiro, to maximize our efficiency within the limited timeframe.

**Team Collaboration:** As a team of four first-time hackathon participants, we established a structured workflow where we held regular meetings to discuss requirements, design decisions, and project planning using Kiro's collaborative features.

**AI-Assisted Development:** We utilized Kiro extensively, taking advantage of both its spec mode and vibe mode to streamline our development process. This allowed us to rapidly prototype and iterate on our ideas while maintaining code quality.

**Development Methodology:** Our approach primarily involved "vibe coding" using Kiro, followed by thorough bug fixing and testing phases. This methodology enabled us to develop features quickly while ensuring functionality.

**Version Control:** We implemented proper software development practices using GitHub for version control, which allowed us to effectively split the work among team members and merge contributions seamlessly.

## Challenges we ran into

**Time Constraints:** The most significant challenge was the extremely limited development window of approximately half a week. This compressed timeline required us to make rapid decisions and prioritize features effectively.

**Limited Project Experience:** As a team, we lacked comprehensive experience in managing a complete software project from conception to deployment. This inexperience led to uncertainty about project scope, feature prioritization, and timeline management.

**AI Tool Reliability:** While Kiro proved to be a powerful development tool, we struggled with determining whether the designs and tasks generated by the AI truly aligned with our vision. We often had too many ideas and weren't confident in evaluating the AI's suggestions against our requirements.

**Technical Expertise Gap:** Our team's limited experience in mobile application development presented additional technical challenges that required extra learning and problem-solving time.

**Project Management Skills:** We recognized that our project management capabilities needed improvement, particularly in terms of coordinating team efforts and maintaining project focus.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

**First Hackathon Success:** All four team members participated in their first hackathon, marking a significant milestone in our development journey and demonstrating our ability to work under pressure.

**Complete Project Delivery:** Despite the challenges and time constraints, we successfully developed and deployed a fully functional web application that addresses our identified problem space.

**Team Collaboration:** We effectively collaborated as a team, leveraging each member's strengths and supporting each other through technical challenges.

**Learning Achievement:** We gained valuable hands-on experience with modern development tools and workflows, significantly expanding our technical skill set in a short period.

**Problem-Solving Capability:** We demonstrated our ability to adapt and find solutions when faced with technical obstacles and time pressures.

## What we learned

**Project Management Importance:** We discovered that effective project management and time management skills are crucial for successful software development. These skills are just as important as technical abilities when working on complex projects.

**AI Development Tools Understanding:** Our team gained deep insights into both the power and limitations of AI-assisted coding tools. We learned that while AI can significantly accelerate development, human oversight and decision-making remain essential.

**Tool Evaluation Skills:** Using Kiro helped us understand that AI development tools can make the development process more transparent and "seeable" for human developers, but we must still critically evaluate whether AI-generated solutions align with our project vision.

**Technical Project Management:** We learned that successful AI-assisted development requires strong project management skills to properly understand and guide the project, ensuring that AI-generated code meets our specifications and requirements.

**Collaborative Development:** We gained experience in team-based software development, including version control practices, task distribution, and collaborative problem-solving.

## What's next for FieldFinance

**Mobile App Development:** Our immediate next step is to transition from a web application to a native mobile application, which will provide better user experience and accessibility for our target audience.

**Enhanced Features:** We plan to implement additional functionality including:
- **OCR Receipt Processing:** Automatic scanning and categorization of receipts to streamline expense tracking
- **Advanced Analytics:** More sophisticated financial insights and predictive analytics to help users make better financial decisions
- **Social Features:** Community elements that allow users to share achievements and learn from others
- **Integration Capabilities:** Connections with banks and financial institutions for automatic transaction import

**User Experience Improvements:** Based on user feedback, we aim to refine the gamification elements and overall user interface to make the app even more engaging and intuitive.

**Market Expansion:** We envision expanding beyond Hong Kong to serve other markets where similar financial literacy challenges exist, adapting the app to local financial systems and cultural preferences.
