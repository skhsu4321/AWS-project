# Goal Management Interface Implementation

This document describes the implementation of Task 10: Build goal management interface.

## Overview

The goal management interface provides a comprehensive system for users to create, edit, track, and manage their savings goals within the Finance Farm Simulator app. The interface transforms traditional financial goal tracking into an engaging, gamified experience.

- Handles goal creation, editing, and deletion
- Integrates with farm visualization through crop representations
- Supports pull-to-refresh functionality
- Shows empty state for new users

### 2. GoalCard (`src/components/goals/GoalCard.tsx`)
- Individual goal display component
- Shows progress visualization with animated progress bar
- Displays goal details (title, category, deadline, amounts)
- Provides quick actions (Add Progress, Edit)
- Long-press context menu for additional options
- Visual status indicators (active, completed, overdue)

### 3. GoalProgressBar (`src/components/goals/GoalProgressBar.tsx`)
- Animated progress visualization component
- Real-time progress updates with smooth animations
- Milestone markers at 25%, 50%, 75%
- Customizable colors and heights
- Percentage display with goal completion celebration

### 4. GoalFilters (`src/components/goals/GoalFilters.tsx`)
- Advanced filtering and sorting system
- Quick filter chips for common filters
- Full modal with comprehensive filter options
- Sort by deadline, progress, amount, or creation date
- Active filter count badge
- Reset functionality

### 5. CreateGoalModal (`src/components/goals/CreateGoalModal.tsx`)
- Goal creation form with validation
- Category selection with visual icons
- Crop type selection for farm integration
- Real-time form validation
- Goal preview functionality
- Support for deadlines and descriptions

### 6. EditGoalModal (`src/components/goals/EditGoalModal.tsx`)
- Goal editing with pre-populated data
- Prevents target amount reduction below current progress
- Status management (Active, Paused, Cancelled)
- Unsaved changes warning
- Progress preservation during edits

### 7. AddProgressModal (`src/components/goals/AddProgressModal.tsx`)
- Progress addition interface
- Quick amount buttons (25%, 50%, 100% of remaining)
- Goal completion detection
- Validation for positive amounts
- Preview of new progress state

### 8. GoalCompletionModal (`src/components/goals/GoalCompletionModal.tsx`)
- Celebration animation for completed goals
- Confetti animation with random colors
- Goal statistics display
- Reward messaging system
- Trophy animation with crop emoji
