# Offline Functionality and Data Synchronization Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides comprehensive offline functionality and data synchronization for the Finance Farm Simulator app. The system ensures users can continue using the app without internet connectivity and automatically syncs data when connection is restored.

## Architecture

### Core Services

#### 1. OfflineService
- **Purpose**: Manages offline detection, operation queuing, and background synchronization
- **Key Features**:
  - Network status monitoring using `@react-native-community/netinfo`
  - Operation queuing with retry logic
  - Background sync when connection is restored
  - Listener pattern for status updates

#### 2. ConflictResolutionService
- **Purpose**: Handles data conflicts that occur when the same data is modified both locally and remotely
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic conflict detection
  - Multiple resolution strategies (local wins, remote wins, auto-merge, manual)
  - Table-specific merge strategies
  - Conflict notification system

#### 3. DataCompressionService
- **Purpose**: Optimizes data for sync by compressing payloads and removing unnecessary fields
- **Key Features**:
  - Run-length encoding compression
  - Data integrity verification with checksums
  - Batch compression/decompression
  - Sync optimization (removes UI-specific fields)

### State Management

#### SyncSlice (Redux)
- Manages offline/online status
- Tracks pending operations and sync progress
- Stores conflict information
- Handles user preferences for sync behavior

### UI Components

#### 1. OfflineIndicator
- Shows current offline status
- Displays pending operations count
- Animated visibility based on connection state

#### 2. SyncStatusIndicator
- Shows sync progress and status
- Displays sync errors and last sync time
- Supports both full and compact modes

#### 3. ConflictResolutionModal
- Interactive conflict resolution interface
- Shows local vs remote data comparison
- Provides resolution options (local, remote, merge, manual)
- Supports bulk conflict resolution

### Custom Hook

#### useOfflineSync
- Provides easy access to offline functionality
- Handles service initialization and cleanup
- Manages listeners and state updates
- Provides methods for queuing operations and resolving conflicts

## Implementation Details

### Operation Queuing

When the app is offline or a sync operation fails, operations are queued locally:

```typescript
interface PendingOperation {
  id: string;
  type: 'CREATE' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE';
  table: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
  userId: string;
  retryCount: number;
  maxRetries: number;
}
```

Operations are:
- Stored in AsyncStorage for persistence
- Processed in chronological order
- Retried up to a maximum number of times
- Removed after successful sync or max retries reached

### Conflict Resolution

Conflicts are detected when:
- Local and remote data exist but differ (UPDATE_UPDATE)
- Local data exists but remote is deleted (DELETE_UPDATE)
- Remote data exists but local is deleted (UPDATE_DELETE)

Resolution strategies:
- **USE_LOCAL**: Keep local changes, discard remote
- **USE_REMOTE**: Keep remote changes, discard local
- **MERGE**: Automatically merge using predefined rules
- **MANUAL**: User provides resolved data

### Merge Strategies by Table

#### Savings Goals
- `title`, `description`, `deadline`: Latest timestamp wins
- `current_amount`: Maximum value (never decrease progress)
- `target_amount`: Latest timestamp wins

#### Expenses
- Most fields: Latest timestamp wins
- Maintains data integrity for financial records

#### Income
- `amount`, `source`: Latest timestamp wins
- `multiplier`, `streak_count`: Maximum value (preserve bonuses)

#### Farm Data
- `health_score`, `level`, `experience`: Maximum value
- `layout`: Latest timestamp wins

### Data Compression

The compression service uses run-length encoding for efficient data transfer:

1. **Optimization**: Removes unnecessary fields (createdAt, updatedAt, UI state)
2. **Compression**: Applies run-length encoding for repeated characters
3. **Integrity**: Generates SHA256 checksums for verification
4. **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple items efficiently

### Network Monitoring

The system monitors network connectivity using NetInfo:
- Detects online/offline state changes
- Identifies network type (WiFi, cellular, etc.)
- Triggers automatic sync when connection is restored
- Respects user preferences (WiFi-only sync)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { useOfflineSync } from '../hooks/useOfflineSync';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    isOnline, 
    isSyncing, 
    pendingOperationsCount,
    queueOperation,
    forceSync 
  } = useOfflineSync();

  const handleCreateGoal = async (goalData) => {
    try {
      // Queue operation for sync
      await queueOperation('CREATE', 'savings_goals', goalData, userId);
      
      // Update local database immediately
      await localDatabase.createGoal(goalData);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to create goal:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <OfflineIndicator />
      <SyncStatusIndicator onPress={() => forceSync()} />
      {/* Your component content */}
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Conflict Resolution

```typescript
import { ConflictResolutionModal } from '../components/common';

function MyScreen() {
  const [showConflicts, setShowConflicts] = useState(false);
  const conflicts = useSelector(selectPendingConflicts);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (conflicts.length > 0) {
      setShowConflicts(true);
    }
  }, [conflicts]);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Your screen content */}
      <ConflictResolutionModal
        visible={showConflicts}
        onClose={() => setShowConflicts(false)}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Manual Sync Control

```typescript
import { OfflineService } from '../services';

const offlineService = OfflineService.getInstance();

// Force sync
await offlineService.forcSync();

// Clear pending operations
await offlineService.clearPendingOperations();

// Get sync status
const status = offlineService.getSyncStatus();
console.log(`${status.pendingOperations} operations pending`);
```

## Configuration

### Sync Preferences

Users can configure sync behavior through Redux actions:

```typescript
import { setSyncPreferences } from '../store/slices/syncSlice';

dispatch(setSyncPreferences({
  autoSyncEnabled: true,
  syncOnlyOnWifi: false,
}));
```

### UI Preferences

Control which indicators are shown:

```typescript
import { setUIPreferences } from '../store/slices/syncSlice';

dispatch(setUIPreferences({
  showOfflineIndicator: true,
  showSyncStatus: true,
}));
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Pending operations are limited to prevent memory issues
- Compression reduces data payload sizes
- Listeners are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks

- Sync operations are batched when possible

### Storage Efficiency
- Compressed data reduces storage requirements
- Old sync data is cleaned up automatically
- Database operations are optimized for mobile devices

## Security

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- Checksums verify data integrity during sync
- Network communications use secure protocols

### Conflict Resolution Security
- User authentication is verified before resolving conflicts
- Audit trail maintains record of resolution decisions
- Sensitive fields require manual resolution

## Error Handling

### Network Errors
- Graceful degradation to offline mode
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- User-friendly error messages

### Data Errors
- Validation before queuing operations
- Rollback mechanisms for failed syncs
- Data integrity checks with checksums

### UI Error Handling
- Error boundaries prevent app crashes
- Loading states during sync operations
- Clear feedback for sync failures

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Smart Sync**: Prioritize critical data for sync
2. **Partial Sync**: Sync only changed fields
3. **Sync Scheduling**: Allow users to schedule sync times
4. **Advanced Compression**: Implement more sophisticated compression algorithms
5. **Sync Analytics**: Track sync performance and patterns

### Scalability Considerations
