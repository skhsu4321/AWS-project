# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Finance Farm Simulator is a gamified financial management mobile app that transforms tedious financial tasks into an engaging farm simulation experience. The app targets both adults and children in Hong Kong, aiming to improve financial literacy by making money management feel rewarding and intuitive. Users "plant" savings goals as seeds that grow into crops over time, while expenses act as "weeds" to be managed. The app promotes daily engagement to build sustainable financial behaviors through visual progress tracking, habit-reinforcing rewards, and story-driven elements.
